# Publication Database #
A group project for the NETB375 course at New Bulgarian University.

## The Task ##
Using the programming language C++ and the programming framework Qt write a computer program digital library. The program has graphical user interface (GUI) and organizes the data needed for the library in a relational database using the PostgreSQL DBMS. The GUI of the program allows the user to:
* Enter data about a publication:
    * Author(s)
    * Title
    * Magazine
    * ISBN/ISSN
    * Year published
    * Pages
    * Keywords
* Search for a publication by:
    * Author
    * Title
    * Keywords
The actions that can be performed by the user using the GUI of the program are:
* Create new database entry
* Delete an existing entry
* Search for an entry

The program allows to generate a citation entry that can be inserted in a BiBTeX database.
